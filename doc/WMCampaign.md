You can [download](/civicrm/delivery/) the list of all signatures.

*Tip: you can add a ?since=20181224 to filter and only look at actions taken after 2018-12-24*

## Overview on the top left column

Total number of signatures (*if you click on it, it will change the columns on the right to look a all signatures instead of the new ones only*. if you mouse over the badge, you see what it represents as a percentage of the emails sent. Some of these signatures didn't come from a mailing but from another channel.

The badges have colors, green means that it's rather better than other campaigns, red that it's worse. We are working on tuning better these numbers, that arerough estimates now.

Signatures can have several status:
- completed (from existing members)
- new members (with an email that we didn't know)
- pending (that haven't opted in or out)
- opt-out signatories that don't want to receive out emails **this doesn't include those that unsubscribe from the mailing** 
- bounced (from an invalid email, they will never become a member)
- activated: existing member that took their second action with this campaign
if you mouse over their badge, you will see the number expressed as a % of the number of signatories. So if you have 1000 signatures and 10 new members, you have 10%

The shares measure when a member clicked on the share button after the signature (on the share step). The precentage is as well based on the number of signatures. This counts all shares, no matter the social media. If you want to see the detail of each media, click on the share bar (on the Acquisition source), and you can see on the "Aquisition media" pie which ones brought new members.


## Language
By default, it shows how the new signatories are spread between new members, pending, optout or bounce. You can select to visualize these numbers as absolute ones or as % of the new signatories, % of emails sent or % of signatures
