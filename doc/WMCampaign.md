You can [download](/civicrm/delivery/) the list of all signatures.

# Overview on the top left column

Total number of signatures. if you mouse over the badge, you see what it represents as a percentage of the emails sent. Some of these signatures didn't come from a mailing but from another channel.

The badges have colors, green means that it's rather better than other campaigns, red that it's worse. We are working on tuning better these numbers, that are now rough estimates.

Signatures can have several status:
- completed (from existing members)
- new members (with an email that we didn't know)
- pending (that haven't opted in or out)
- bounced (from an invalid email, they will never become a member)
if you mouse over their badge, you will see the number expressed as a % of the number of signatories. So if you have 1000 signatures and 10 new members, you have 10%

The shares measure when a member clicked on the share button after the signature (on the share step). The precentage is as well based on the number of signatures. This counts all shares, no matter the social media. If you want to see the detail of each media, click on the share bar (on the Acquisition source), and you can see on the "Aquisition media" pie which ones brought new members.
